team policies. We suggest you start with this:

We all show equal commitment to our objective. We all take part in deciding how work should be allocated. 
We are committed to helping each other learn. We acknowledge good contributions from team members. 
We handle disagreements and conflicts constructively within the team. 
We are able to give constructive criticism to one another and to accept it ourselves. 
We all turn up to meetings and stay to the end. We are good at making sure that everyone knows whatâ€™s going on. 
When one of us is under pressure, they inform the rest of the team. 
When one of us is under pressure, others offer to help them. We trust each other.
